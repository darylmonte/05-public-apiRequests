# Public API Requests
My fifth project for the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree.
In this project, I've created an employee directory using the Random User Generator API.
Clicking the employee's name or image will open a modal window with more detailed information.
I've added a search feature so that employees can be filtered by name.
I've added navigation buttons to switch back and forth between employees when the detail modal window is open.

STYLE CHANGES
- Changed the color of the modal window card from white to dary gray
- Changed the color of the fonts in the modal window from black to white.
- Swapped the colors of the modal window's close button
- The search and filter feature works by highlighting the employee card that matches the text in the search form
